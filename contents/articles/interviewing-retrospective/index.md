This past two weeks I've had about dozen interviews for software engineering intern positions at various companies, and I'd like to discuss what I thought went well and what didn't.

<span class="more"></span>

### What I did well
- prepared for technical questions beforehand by reading [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
- did some [personal projects](https://github.com/joemercer/) to provide talking points for character questions
- refreshed my memory on [basic algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/joemercer/interview-a-la-JavaScript)
- discussed my strategy for tackling a problem before coding anything
- went through line by line and explained my code after finishing the program
- programmed in JavaScript, regardless of the job description
- planned some questions to ask at the end (team structure, common technologies, where would I fit in)
- always got the name of someone to contact for logistical (pay, housing, transportation) information

### What I didn't do well
- fell victim to nerves on my first interview
- didn't plan domain specific questions (to show insight into a specific company)
- didn't review JavaScript specific questions (and got tripped up on a closures question as a result)
- didn't get much opportunity to show my projects

### What I should differently next time
- do a mock interview with a friend to shake out the nerves
- review common themes in questions and attempt to continually push useful code snippets to Github
- come up with a more demo-able app for interviews
