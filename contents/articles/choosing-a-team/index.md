I think one of the most important and interesting parts of any project is the team that builds it. In most cases I would say that the team is even more impactful than the idea. So the question is, what should we be looking for in a team?

I don't know if I can answer this question in general, but for me specifically, I want people who are (in order of importance):

**Mindful** - know their strengths and limits, and are confident in voicing them

**Transparent** - nobody on the team should be hiding anything, or obfuscating their intentions - we don't have time to decipher meanings

**Good at teaching (or talking) / Good at learning (or listening)** - undoubtably in the course of the hackathon we will have to share knowledge and it's important that we can disperse this knowledge quickly and without causing conflict

**Flexible** - when conflicts arise the team needs to be able to reach a compromise fast (part of this is being able to listen and understand others' idea's, and being able to take criticisms of your idea)

**Energetic** - pretty obvious I think

More specifically what skills does the team need (in order of importance)? This is obviously highly dependent on the product, and I generally focus on making web applications so I'll answer the question for me specifically.

1. Me (full stack developer comfortable working at any level in the stack)
2. Designer (Photoshop, CSS, jQuery, general style)
3. Server / opsy developer (good at setting up and managing the infrastructure pieces: databases, hosting, etc)
4. Business guy (good at talking, making presentations, writing, explaining, generally likeable, knows the channels of the internet (Reddit, Youtube, etc), marketing, has connections)
5. Full stack / focus on testing (understands testing technologies, writing unit tests and integration tests)
6. More developers

It should be noted though that there's an ideal number of people to have (more isn't necessarily better). My rule is that each person on the team should always have work that they can do. If you have someone on the team who doesn't have anything to do then they are just slowing you down.
